# Document-Based-Rag-Model
This project is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based chatbot that allows users to upload their own documents and query them intelligently. It combines embedding-based semantic search with LLM-powered response generation to deliver accurate, context-aware answers directly sourced from the uploaded content.
